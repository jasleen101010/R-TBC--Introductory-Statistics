Introductory Statistics is written by Sheldon M Ross. The textbook was published by Elsevier INC, UK in 2010.<br>

I started working on the textbook companion of this book in 2nd year of college, under the FOSSEE Program by Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.<br>

The 800 pages long book was transformed into 183 codeable examples!<br>

You can find the PDF of my compiled textbook ![here!](https://github.com/jasleen101010/R-TBC-Introductory-Statistics/blob/main/Introductory%20Statistics_Sheldon%20M.%20Ross.pdf)

What makes me even happier is that the book is completely open-source and available for whoever wishes to learn R Programming.<br>
I have come to realize that R Programming is still a niche in the world of Data Science and I am really honored to have done my part to bring it to the limelight!<br>
